# Minimal Mark Ruler Calculator  

Minimal Mark Ruler Calculator: A Java program that calculates the minimal number of marks needed on a ruler to measure all integer distances from 1 to X using differences between mark pairs.

## OBJECTIVE  

**PURPOSE**  
This project implements an algorithm to construct optimal sparse rulers - rulers that use the fewest possible marks while still being able to measure all integer lengths from 1 to a target length X through differences between mark pairs.
