# Minimal Mark Ruler Calculator  

A Java program that finds the fewest number of marks needed on a ruler to measure all integer distances from 1 to X using only the differences between pairs of marks.  

---

## OBJECTIVE  
**Purpose**:  
This project solves the problem of constructing a minimal ruler where the distances between any pair of marks can measure all integer lengths from 1 to X. Unlike traditional rulers, it optimizes for the least number of marks while maintaining full functionality.
